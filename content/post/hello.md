Tbh, I don't really know what to write here. A few years ago, when I started out programming, I never thought of or wanted to start blogging. Hell, I never wanted to get into security back then. But things change!.

Here I am, editing the first blog post :) 

Anyway, about this blog. Here I will be posting my projects, research, guides, and other useless information on programming, system security, and reverse engineering. I'm also looking forward to start posting malware analysis reports and CTF writeups.

So, I think that's it :3

#spread anarchy!
