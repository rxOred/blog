I started writing code with java, when my school's ICT society recruited 12 years olds. All I did was copying code around. though we havent learned much,
it was a great start. Since the society fell apart cause our seniors who taught us had their final exams incoming.

That's when i met with C++. My language of choice. I started writing my own code. eventually moved to arduino, game development and security.

Now, this blog post is not about how started programming. This is about what i think about functional programming and how much regret i have for not learning it 
.

The reason why talked about how i got into programming is to emphasize that, i never had formal education and therefore, I was not forced to do or learn anything
. I learned things that seems cool and interesting to me. And, that did not include `functional programming`. for a while.

I cant really remember how i even encountered the term `functional programming` but from what i remember, i first thought C as a functional programming language,
And i also didnt knew that they teach you functional programming in the college.

After two years and doing some real world development, i realised, 'now, i can call myself a dev, but do i have the same knowlegde about computers as those compusci kids?'. That kinda scared me at the first cause, all Ive learned through years, are mostly practical stuff. maybe the most theorical thing that Ive learned 
is probably OS theory. 

So then I started researching more about what they teach you in college. then, I started learning some data structures and algorithms. though i didnt deeper, i 
learned stacks, qeues, binary trees, sorting algos and so on. Still, functional programming was not in my head.

That's when I felt I should revise my math skills. i went through some stuff iv learned when i was doing OLs and had to use youtube cause, i havent written any notes :).

Oneday, when search youtube for some math concepts, I came across a conference talk, which was titled with something like `type theory - mathematics and programming`. I was like 'okay, this sounds cool' and watched. That talk made me want to learn more about the topics, functional programming and it's relationship 
between math.

as programmers, we are used to think of a function as something along the lines of 'a piece of code that takes inputs and represent steps to perform a specific task,'. But to mathematicians, no not really.

And yes. fucntion is something that computer science borrow from math. hell computer science itself is a branch of math. 

Let's see the mathematician's definition for the term `function`
