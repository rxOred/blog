# why?

When My pixel fell off, it broke its display. I couldnt go out to buy a new one because there was covid curfew at that time. However, a some weeks later, 
my cousine gifted me with a phone, to be more specific, a samsumg m02. She told me that she bought it from a SLT-Mobitel shop and i cant use service any ISP
other than SLT-Mobitel.

I was kinda fine with it first. I also used their service before. But it became annoying since I've also been using service of other ISPs like Hutch, Dialog.
And when Im running low on Wi-Fi, i heavily rely on mobile data. which made this SIM restrictions something too far from `just annoying`.

Thats when i though i should do something to it.

Here, in this blog post, Im going to explain each step that im going to take. And which means, im not writing this post after bypassing those restrictions.

# tools

Since Im still depending on my parents, i mostly use open source / free tools. 
    - android studio  
    - adb
    - frida

# Overview? i guess so
