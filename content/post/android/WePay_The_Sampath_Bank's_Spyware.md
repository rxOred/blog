## Introduction

Despite the ongoing crisis, BMICH bookfair was there. I went 3 days, only in first one I bought books and the other two were more fun oriented.

There I encountered this offer, by Sampath bank, which basically said, if I use their WePay for payments, I will get a discount of 10% from each book. 

Well, as a guy who values money and sicne the offer sounded legitimate (coming from a well known bank in the country), I agreed. But you know, shit happens.
