rxOred's real name is Jayod, and I'm a 17 year-old, introverted, self-taught programmer from Sri Lanka. Other than building software, I also do reverse engineering and malware analysis. 

I'm also interested in firmware security and computer vision. As for my higher education, I follow a higher national diploma while doing A/Ls in technology + higher mathematics stream. 
I prefer to work alone but, I'm not hesitant to work with other developers and security/software engineers because the resulting experience is invalueble to me. :)
