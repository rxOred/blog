rxOred's real name is Jayod, and I'm a 17-year-old, introverted, self-taught programmer from Sri Lanka. Other than building software, I also do reverse engineering and malware analysis. I'm also interested in firmware security and computer vision. 

About my education, I started programming when I was 12 with Java. Then I taught myself many things related computer science and computer security.
And I'm familiar with C/C++ (language of choice :), assembly, python and golang. Currently I follow a higher national diploma while doing A/Ls in technology + higher mathematics stream. 

I prefer to work alone but, I'm not hesitant to work with other developers and security/software engineers because the resulting experience is invaluable to me. :)
